## What This Script Made For?
- This code was created by [Belamiri Zakarya](https://github.com/kakaa2993) to force Win 10 to sync the time with the time server in Windows 10 automatically without the user needing to do it manually.
- The script inspired from [this](https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/all/how-to-force-windows-10-time-to-synch-with-a-time/20f3b546-af38-42fb-a2d0-d4df13cc8f43) question.
- Because in some machines that have Win 10 the time display isn't correct, so you need to change it every time you restart your PC with manual work.
- This script can fix the problem automatically with a click.

## The Requirement?
- This script needs only the connection to the internet to work!

<br>

## How To Use This Script?
- Just run the script ``as administrator``.

and voila! That is all that you need.

## Can I Use The Script Automatically?
You can make the script run automatically using ``Task Scheduler`` from Windows, here is a video showing you how you can use it manually [on YouTube](https://youtu.be/RSwOrK4m82U?si=PzW9tNA-4Gh97k0e).

Or you can also do it with ``cmd``:
- To create a task that runs a batch script "at log in" for any user and "as administrator" using the command line:
```batch
schtasks /create /tn "Name_of_Task" /sc onlogon /ru SYSTEM /rl HIGHEST /tr "C:\path\to\your\batch\sync_time_win.bat"
```

### PONTUS EDIT:
```
SÃ¤tt repeat interval till 1 hour indefinitely
```

Explanation of the command:

- `/sc onlogon`: the task should run when any user logs on.
- `/ru SYSTEM`: The task should run under the `SYSTEM` account, which has administrative privileges.
- `/rl HIGHEST`: Sets the privilege level to the highest available, effectively running the task as an administrator.
- `/tr "C:\path\to\your\batch\sync_time_win.bat"`: Specifies the path to the batch script that you want to run.

Replace `"Name_of_Task"` with the desired name for your task and `"C:\path\to\your\batch\sync_time_win.bat"` with the actual path to your batch script.

After running this command, the task will be created in Task Scheduler, and it will execute the specified batch script whenever any user logs on, running with administrative privileges.
Here's a table summarizing the available options for the `schtasks /create` command in Windows:
